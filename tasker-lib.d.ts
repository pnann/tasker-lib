     * of their dependencies.
     *
     * Cycles are not supported and will result in an error being thrown.
     *
     * The task tree cannot be modified while task execution is in progress. Attempting to do so will result in an error
     * being thrown.
     *
     * Adding a task that already exists with the same name will result in an error being thrown unless throwOnOverwrite is
     * set to false.
     *
     * Supports the following task types:
     *  - Synchronous tasks.
     *  - Promise tasks.
     *  - "done" callback for asynchronous tasks.
     *
     * Refer to README.md for examples.
