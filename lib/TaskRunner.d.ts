/**
 * A basic task runner with support for asynchronous tasks. To use, create a task tree before selecting a task to run
 * by name. The task as well as any and all dependent tasks will be asynchronously executed. Tasks can consume the results
 * of their dependencies.
 *
 * Cycles are not supported and will result in an error being thrown.
 *
 * The task tree cannot be modified while task execution is in progress. Attempting to do so will result in an error
 * being thrown.
 *
 * Adding a task that already exists with the same name will result in an error being thrown unless throwOnOverwrite is
 * set to false.
 *
 * Supports the following task types:
 *  - Synchronous tasks.
 *  - Promise tasks.
 *  - "done" callback for asynchronous tasks.
 *
 * Refer to README.md for examples.

     * @param task - A function to execute for this task. May be a synchronous function (regular return value), promise function (return a promise), or other
